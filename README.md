# BreastSurgery-Analysis

## Introduction
The BreastSurgeryDataAnalysis project aims to analyze clinical data of patients who underwent breast surgeries.
This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using charts to help easily identify patterns and trends.
The analysis focuses on key factors such as patient age, site of the mass, molecular subtype, and pathological type.


## Project Structure
- **data/** : Raw and processed data files  
- **notebooks/** : Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis  
- **scripts/** : Python scripts for data cleaning and analysis  
- **visualizations/** : Generated charts and graphs  


## Tools Used
- Python   
- Pandas: Library for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook: for interactive data analysis  


## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   Data was collected from [Assiut University Hospital, General Surgery Department], including patient demographics, surgery types, clinical outcomes, and alot of relevant variables.
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handling missing values, correcting errors, and converting variables into proper formats for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Investigating distributions by age, site of mass, molecular type, pathological type and comparing outcomes to get the relation between diffrent varibles.
4. **Visualization**  
   Creating charts to visualize distributions and relationships between variables.



## Project Goal
To provide clinicians and researchers with data-driven insights on breast surgery patients that can improve healthcare quality and surgical outcomes.
